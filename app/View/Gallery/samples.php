		<p>The gallery exists in two versions. The &ldquo;plain&rdquo; versions use a primitive but very stable technique. The whole page (including all images) gets reloaded during pagination. It is not very user-friendly, but at least it is free of bugs due to its simplicity. Another advantage of this ancient technique is that it works in any kind of browsers, even in old ones, and even if the user disables JavaScript intentionally or accidentally.</p>
		<p>The other version (labeled here as &ldquo;JavaScript&rdquo; version or &ldquo;js&rdquo; in short) is more resource-efficient, quicker, user-friendlier. During pagination, only the images move and chonge size, but nothing gets reloaded. This provides a better visual effect, but this technique is prone to errors and bugs. Now this version is buggy yet, some samples work, while others are still wrong. Even when the bugs get fixed, this techique is very sensitive to user settings and browser versions.</p>
